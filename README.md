[**DUAL** is a table automatically created by Oracle Database. Selecting from a DUAL
table is useful for computing a constant expression with the SELECT statement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUAL_table)

My constraint is having no write access to a corporate database for which I have
partially complete data from a SQL query. The other relevant data exists currently
in a flat file (.CSV). I need to UNION these 2 sources of data into one dataset.
To do this my goal is a programmatic approach where I can convert each row of
the flat file into a Oracle compliant SQL query string which can then be inserted
into my SQL query without any manual labor other than a copy and paste.

**So the goal of this project is to be able to write a program that:**

* Reads a flat file row by row
* converts the row values from the flat file into a valid **SELECT â€¦ FROM DUAL** SQL statement
* The N rows from the flat file are converted and written to a .txt file as
  N unioned SQL queries FROM DUAL table.
* The contents of the .txt file can then be added into a valid SQL statement
  for unioning these data with a similarly formatted query from a database.


A sample .CSV is included in this repo from [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)
of the results from all international football matches from 1872 to 2018. This
sample dataset will be read into the function and output as a
SELECT FROM dual set of UNION PLSQL statements captured in a .txt file. These
contents could then be copied and pasted into a query front-end to generate
a temporary table of data in lieu of being able to write data or create tables
in your SQL environment.
